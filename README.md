## 🚀 Overview

In today's complex digital landscape, managing IT and cybersecurity risks is paramount. However, many organizations, especially Small to Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), find commercial GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) tools to be expensive, overly complex, or restrictive.

**FortressOS** aims to democratize effective risk management by providing a powerful, flexible, and transparent open-source solution. Built with a modern technology stack, it offers an intuitive user experience and aligns with industry best practices and standards like ISO 2700x, NIST RMF, and CIS Controls. Whether you're establishing a new risk management program or looking for a better way to manage an existing one, FortressOS is designed to adapt to your needs.

## ✨ Key Features

FortressOS provides a comprehensive suite of tools to manage your risk lifecycle:

- **🛡️ Asset Management:** Maintain a detailed inventory of your critical assets, their value, and ownership.
- **🔬 Threat & Vulnerability Management:** Identify and track threats and vulnerabilities relevant to your assets. Import data from common scanning tools.
- **⚖️ Risk Assessment (Qualitative & Quantitative):**
  - Conduct **qualitative assessments** using configurable risk matrices (Likelihood x Impact).
  - Perform **quantitative assessments** by calculating Single Loss Expectancy (SLE), Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO), and Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE).
- **🔗 Risk Register:** A centralized dashboard to view, track, and manage all identified risks.
- **⚙️ Control Management:** Define, implement, and monitor security controls. Map controls from standard libraries (NIST 800-53, ISO 27002, CIS Controls) or create custom ones.
- **📊 Compliance Tracking (Coming Soon):** Map controls to compliance frameworks (ISO 27001, PCI DSS, etc.) and track your compliance posture.
- **📈 Reporting & Dashboards:** Visualize your risk landscape with intuitive dashboards and generate insightful reports.
- **👤 User & Role Management:** Secure access with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- **🐳 Dockerized & 12-Factor:** Easy to deploy, self-host, and scale, following modern cloud-native principles.
- **🎨 Modern UI/UX:** Built with Next.js and shadcn/ui for a clean, responsive, and enjoyable user experience.

## 🎯 Why FortressOS?

- **🌐 Truly Open Source:** Free to use, modify, and distribute under the MIT license. No vendor lock-in.
- **💻 Self-Hostable:** Maintain full control over your data and deployment environment.
- **✨ Modern & Intuitive:** Say goodbye to clunky interfaces. Enjoy a clean, user-friendly design.
- **🔧 Customizable & Extensible:** Adapt the platform to your specific needs. The open-source nature allows for community-driven enhancements.
- **🔗 Standards-Aligned:** Incorporates principles from leading risk management frameworks (NIST, ISO).
- **👥 Community-Driven:** Be part of a growing community shaping the future of open-source risk management.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

FortressOS is built with a modern and robust technology stack:

- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Backend:** *(To be solidified - e.g., Node.js/NestJS, Python/FastAPI, Go)*
- **Database:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (Recommended)
- **API:** RESTful or GraphQL
- **Containerization:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version X.X+)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version X.X+)
- Minimum system resources: (e.g., 2 CPU cores, 4GB RAM - specify based on expected load)

### Option 1: Quick Start with Docker (Recommended for Users)

This is the easiest way to get FortressOS up and running.

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/fortressos.git](https://github.com/yourusername/fortressos.git)
    cd fortressos
    ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the necessary configurations (e.g., database credentials, application secrets).

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Open .env and edit the variables
    ```

3. **Run with Docker Compose:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4. **Access FortressOS:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:YOUR_APP_PORT` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` - check your `docker-compose.yml` or `.env` for the exact port).

### Option 2: Manual Setup for Development (For Contributors)

For those who want to contribute to FortressOS development:

1. **Fork and Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/fortressos.git](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/fortressos.git)
    cd fortressos
    ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    *(Instructions will depend on the chosen backend stack. Example for Node.js):*

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install # or yarn install
    # Setup backend .env file
    ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend # or ./
    npm install # or yarn install
    # Setup frontend .env file (e.g., for API endpoints)
    ```

4. **Setup Database:**
    Ensure you have a running PostgreSQL instance. Create a database and user for FortressOS, then update your backend `.env` file with the connection details.
    *(Optionally, provide a script to set up the dev database)*

5. **Run Migrations & Seed Data (if applicable):**
    *(Example for a Node.js backend with a migration tool):*

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run db:migrate
    npm run db:seed # Optional
    ```

6. **Start Backend Development Server:**
    *(Example for Node.js):*

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    ```

7. **Start Frontend Development Server:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend # or ./
    npm run dev
    ```

8. **Access FortressOS:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by the Next.js dev server).
